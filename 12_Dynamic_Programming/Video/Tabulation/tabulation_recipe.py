# Visualize the problem as a table
# Size the table based on inputs (+1)
# Initialize the table with default table
#   Be careful of return type, chose return type for table
# Seed the trivial answer into the table
# Iterate through the table
# Fill further positions based on the current position
#   Focus on options at given time in problem
